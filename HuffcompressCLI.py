Huffcompress Command Line Interface

Welcome to Huffcompress, a file compression and decompression tool 
powered by the Huffman algorithm. This Command Line Interface (CLI) version 
provides a seamless and efficient way to compress and decompress plain text files.


Running the CLI

Before diving into the CLI, ensure Python 3 is installed on your system. 
To run the CLI interface, please follow these steps:

  1. Navigate to the directory where the Huffman program files are located using the command line: cd path/to/huffman/program

                                                      (or)
                                                      
     Add the Huffman program directory to the system's PATH variable for more convenient access.

  2. Then, execute the following command: python HuffcompressCLI.py
